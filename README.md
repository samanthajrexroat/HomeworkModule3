## Description

This application generates a random secure password that meets specific criteria.  

When the user clicks a button, they are prompted to provide a length for their password.  The user is then asked a series of questions as to which type of characters they would like their password to include.

The application then runs a series of functions that generate a randomly generated and novel password based on the user's input.
